## About This Project

This is a C++ chatroom system built using sockets and multithreading.

ðŸ‘‰ Forked from [cjchirag7/chatroom-cpp](https://github.com/cjchirag7/chatroom-cpp), and extended with the following features:

- Added XYZ feature (e.g. encryption, command handling, etc.)
- Improved error handling / multithreaded behavior
- Enhanced user experience / documentation

This was done as part of a networking project during Thapar's placement process.
